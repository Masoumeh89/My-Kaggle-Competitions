# Kaggle Competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets


## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle for the competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets". It can be accessed at:
- [Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

The dataset consists of the following files:
- `train.csv`: The training set containing tweets labeled as disaster or not.
- `test.csv`: The test set for which you need to predict whether each tweet is about a real disaster.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file in the correct format.

Each tweet in the training and test sets contains:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each tweet.
- `text`: The text of the tweet.
- `location`: The location from where the tweet was sent (may be blank).
- `keyword`: A keyword from the tweet (may be blank).
- `target`: (Only in `train.csv`) Denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0).
